üéÆ Glitch Pilgrim
Glitch Pilgrim is a minimalist, retro-inspired arcade game where you navigate a world constantly on the brink of digital collapse. As you play, the very fabric of reality shifts, introducing new challenges and visual distortions.

üïπÔ∏è Gameplay
The core objective is simple: avoid the glitches!

Corruption: Each time your player collides with a glitch (the colored blocks), your "corruption" level increases.

Dynamic Dimensions: As your corruption grows, you'll be transported into different "dimensions." Each dimension features unique visual themes, color palettes, and altered gameplay mechanics:

Prime Reality: Standard physics and controls.

Mirror Dimension: Inverted controls, challenging your reflexes.

Pixel Decay: Reality fragments, introducing visual noise.

Void Sector: No boundaries, allowing you to wrap around the screen.

Code Overflow: A chaotic phase where your player randomly teleports across the screen, simulating "reality loops."

Cycle of Chaos: The "Code Overflow" dimension is a timed event. After a short duration, the system stabilizes, and your corruption level resets, returning you to "Prime Reality" to begin the cycle anew. This creates a challenging loop where you experience escalating chaos followed by a brief reprieve.

‚ú® Features
Retro Pixel Art Style: Immerse yourself in a classic arcade aesthetic with vibrant, glitchy visuals.

Dynamic Audio: A melodic background track that subtly shifts in tempo and pitch as corruption increases, enhancing the game's evolving atmosphere.

Responsive Design: The game adapts to various screen sizes, ensuring a consistent experience on desktop and mobile.

Progressive Difficulty: The increasing corruption and changing dimension rules provide a natural difficulty curve.

Subtle Sound Effects: Soft, non-intrusive sound effects for glitch collisions and dimension shifts.
